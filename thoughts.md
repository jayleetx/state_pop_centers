Things this maybe should do

- [x] Show progression of state population centers over time, similar to [this](https://www2.census.gov/geo/pdfs/reference/cenpop2010/centerpop_mean2010.pdf) but statewise.

- [x] Compare population centers to
    - [x] geographic centers
    - [x] capitals
    - [x] largest cities

- [x] Have zooming options for 'whole state' and 'region of center movement' (useful in states where population doesn't move a ton)

- [x] In data sets, have seamless transition between states and US measures. That is, `long_pop_centers` should have a few rows for the US population centers over time

- [ ] (first two done) Map on middle/upper left, controls to right of that
    - [x] check boxes for displaying comparisons from #2
    - [x] drop down for which state
    - [ ] Overall option for 'all states in 1940' or 'all years in Texas' - this should probably be different things

- [x] Bottom display of the name of the capital and the largest city (these change over time so maybe stick to 2018 data)

- [ ] (maybe) state capitals change over time, so add this in. very manual data entry

- [x] Figure out how to make maps work good

- [ ] d3.js??????????

- [ ] Population at that time

- [x] Distance from state capital at that time
