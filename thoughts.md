Things this maybe should do

1. Show progression of state population centers over time, similar to [this](https://www2.census.gov/geo/pdfs/reference/cenpop2010/centerpop_mean2010.pdf) but statewise.

2. Compare population centers to
    + geographic centers
    + capitals
    + largest cities

3. Have zooming options for 'whole state' and 'region of center movement' (useful in states where population doesn't move a ton)

4. In data sets, have seamless transition between states and US measures. That is, `long_pop_centers` should have a few rows for the US population centers over time

5. Map on middle/upper left, controls to right of that
    + check boxes for displaying comparisons from #2
    + drop down for which state
    + Overall option for 'all states in 1940' or 'all years in Texas' - this should probably be different things

6. Bottom display of the name of the capital and the largest city (these change over time so maybe stick to 2018 data)

7. (maybe) state capitals change over time, so add this in. very manual data entry

8. Figure out how to make maps work good

9. d3.js??????????
